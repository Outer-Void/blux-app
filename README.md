# BLUX App

BLUX App is a read-only window into:
- user intent
- collaborative model output
- discernment analysis
- execution receipts

BLUX App does not:
- decide
- execute
- enforce
- optimize
- authorize

All intelligence and enforcement live outside this application.

This repository exists to prove the platform shape — not capability.
