# BLUX App

BLUX App is a read-only window into user intent, collaborative model output,
discernment analysis, and execution receipts.

It has no authority and does not execute, enforce, or optimize.

All intelligence and enforcement live outside this application. This repository
exists to prove platform shape, not capability.
